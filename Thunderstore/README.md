# MoreItems

A simple mod that adds more items to the game, intended to be balanced and fit well into the vanilla game. 

#### THIS MOD IS IN EARLY DEVELOPMENT AND MAY HAVE BUGS

A lot of the assets in this mod are placeholder assets.
I highly recommend that when using this mod ( or any mod ) you understand that bugs can happen.

## Currently implemented:
- Serrated Knife: Your critical strikes do more damage.
- Static Charge: Your critical strikes build up static charge to shock the next enemy to attack you.
